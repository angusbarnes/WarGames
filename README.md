# WarGames

This was an experimental project I wrote when first learning to code, I was around 15 at the age of writing this. This was the first project I did without any specific guidance from a tutorial or reference. It features two teams of 2D soldiers which chase eachother around and shoot until one team wins. Its basic, the code is bad, but I keep it here for sentimental reasons.
